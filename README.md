# NearSense - Real-Time Sentiment Analysis Powered by Masa AI for Crypto Trading

### Project Description:

NearSense leverages the power of AI-driven real-time sentiment analysis from Twitter using MASA AI to provide actionable insights for cryptocurrency traders on the NEAR blockchain. Built using the Masa AI API, NearSense captures tweets from influential Crypto Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) to analyze market sentiment, offering traders an edge in understanding the shifting moods that can drive price movements.

Crypto KOL marketing has proven impactful in the blockchain space, where the voices of key figures often sway market trends. By tapping into these live social signals, NearSense processes tweets in real-time, running them through a sentiment analysis model to quantify and categorize the overall sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. This data is instantly displayed to traders, providing them with a sentiment-backed indicator that can be integrated into their trading strategies on the NEAR blockchain.
